In the game "Bomberman," you play as a character who places bombs to blow up walls and eliminate enemies.
The goal is to clear the path and reach the door that leads to the next level while avoiding the explosions from your own bombs and those of the enemies.
At the start of each level, you begin in an area filled with walls, some of which can be destroyed and others that cannot.

You need to place bombs using an action button and move away to avoid getting hit by the blast. 
Blowing up walls can reveal special items like bomb upgrades, increased movement speed, or additional bombs.
Each level also has enemies roaming the maze, and if they touch you, you lose a life. 
You must eliminate them using your bombs before they reach you.

Once you find the door, you can move on to the next level, but to open it, you must first eliminate all the enemies in the level.
The game requires careful planning and precise timing in placing bombs to succeed without getting trapped or hurt.
The game continues like this, with levels becoming increasingly challenging as you progress.
